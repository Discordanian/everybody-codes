# Everybody Codes 2025

Written in Godot's gdscript.

Input data must be copied to the "user://" directory in the same format that Everybody Codes downloads the file as.
Example data can be pasted in the 3 windows on the screen for testing.  Nothing stops you from pasting the 
actual input into the example windows for convenience.
